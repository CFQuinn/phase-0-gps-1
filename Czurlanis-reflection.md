##What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Chris and I both seemed confident with most of git we struggled slightly with the merge conflict and git fetch but worked together to figure it out.

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The most useful skills I learned from Chris was how to delete a branch in git  and the “co” short cut for “checkout”.

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

Chris seemed to be more fatrmilar with mark down so I asked him how to **bold**  I was also having trouble getting sublime to render my .md file in the browser both Chris and Gary showed me a good website to use for rendering .md files.

##What still confuses you about Git?

Git seems pretty straightforward but I’m sure as projects and conflicts become bigger they will be confusing.

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

Had a little hiccup with my microphone not working but once I switched from chrome to safari everything came together.  My first Gps was great glad I got paired with someone as knowledgeable as Chris and Gary.
