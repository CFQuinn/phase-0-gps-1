What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

*I would have to say the part of git i was struggling the most with prior to the GPS session was pushing and merging updates to GitHub.*

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
*I definetly got a better understanding of GitHub and how it works in collaboration with Git.*

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

*A lot of the questions I asked both my pair and my guide were focused on if I was headed in the right direction. I understood most of the concepts, but just needed reassurance at some times. George was great about suggesting direction and ways to get there.*

What still confuses you about Git?

*I feel like I have a pretty solid understand of the basics of Git and GitHub. I'm sure there will be more speedbumps along the way. Memorizing those basic comands is the priorety for now.*

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? 

*It was comfortable and very helpful. Gary (the instructor) did a great job of only chiming in when we absolutley needed help, and George intrduced me to some valuable shortcuts. Overall it was a solid expierence.*
